For the btc.py

You can Edit the coords, by default it will be set at 10,100
I made it for waveshare v2 2.9"

For the spotify.py

First you'll have to register an app at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/
and set it up.

After that run the test.py on your pc after you've added the client id and secret
you'll get a .cache file. Move that file to the pwnagotchi's /usr/local/share/pwnagotchi/custom-plugins folder.

Now you have to add the client id and secret to the spotify.py

If everything is done corretly, then it should work.

Feel free to dm me on discord if you have any questions: roli0810
